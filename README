ttf_preload is a utility to allow a program to use a font without having to
install the font system-wide. Under normal circumstances it's much better to
just install the font system-wide.

Usage: ttf_preload /path/to/myfont.ttf inkscape

Notes:
- This program actually preloads the entire directory of fonts into fontconfig.
If you absolutely need to only add a single font file without also adding other
font files found in the same directory, you will need to move your font to a
directory by itself.

- This program can also preload OTF files.
